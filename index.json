The reason is that MQTT is simpler than the HTTP protocol used on web pages, and the packet messages transmitted are smaller. Ideal for sending and receiving data under limited bandwidth and computing resources. As for what the specific MQTT protocol is doing, let us look at the picture below to explain. agreement description\rFrom the picture, we can see that there is a place similar to the MQTT brain in the middle, generally called the MQTT Broker, where the message publishing (Publish) on the left is transferred to the Subscriber (Subscribe) on the right. This completes a message delivery. Question: So how do we confirm that publishing and communication can be delivered correctly without getting other noise? From the picture, you can see that there are some path-like things where each project is connected. This is the so-called topic. Only when publishing and subscribing to the same topic can one receive messages. If you want to obtain multiple topics, you can set # in the path to read multiple topics, but please note that / represents layering and there is no / at the beginning of the first layer.
